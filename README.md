The full dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) was described and analyzed in:

S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems (2014), doi:10.1016/j.dss.2014.03.001.

Relevant Information:

This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb. This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns). Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included. Note: the file can be read in R using: d=read.table("bank-additional-full.csv",header=TRUE,sep=";")

The zip file includes 4 datasets:

1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date
(from May 2008 to November 2010)
2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this
dataset with fewer inputs).
4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older
version of this dataset with fewer inputs).
The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).

Number of Instances: 41188 for bank-additional-full.csv
